uMobile is a new open source initiative to bring campus applications, content, and data to mobile devices. The project provides a native app for iPhone and Android devices, as well as browser-based content for other smartphones.

uMobile enables a single code base to provide both browser-based and native-app functionality, allowing institutions to produce mobile applications in a familiar environment.

Initial uMobile modules comprise of campus maps, directory, announcements, search, courses, campus news/ RSS, and calendars.
